Party bus London site proposal
I am a self taught front end developer that has been asked by the company Party Bus London to design a website for them.
This landing page is my first proposal for the Party bus company. I received positive reviews and will continue to add more functionality if required.
I have posted it here on github to show case my design and frontend knowledge. I will soon migrate this project to React which I am currently learning.
